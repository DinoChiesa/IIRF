2. fix logging so that the log "header" is always emitted regardless of
   the ordering of RewriteLogLevel and RewriteLog in the ini file .

3. replace in the source code, all "Site" with "Vdir".  No externally
   visible change due to this.  It was just confusing to read the
   source code.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat, 12 Dec 2009  17:32

1. detect and warn on multiple occurrences of various one-time-only
   directives in the ini files.  Ex: RewriteLogLevel, RewriteEngine,
   CondSubstringBackrefFlag.

2. Remove the StrictParsing directive.  This was a hack, designed to
   allow people to write bad rules.  It shouldn't be there. Now, broken
   rules will generate warnings as they should.  Also removed the
   documentation for this hack.

------------------------------------------------------------------

2. ProxyPass directive.

3. StatusUrl directive, specifies HTTP URL for status inquiries.
   workitem 23459.

7. [G] = Gone modifier

8. [NC] as synonym for [I] (case insensitivity)

9. various bug fixes


------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.14

1. Fixed a bug where the case-folding flag was a backslash,
   resulting in bad case folding for %{REQUEST_FILENAME} in a
   RewriteCond, for example.  The new case-folding flag
   character is #.

2. Fixed a bug where a string like %100 (with a subscript out of
   range) in a replacement string caused the filter to crash.

3. Made reading of the config files much more robust.  Broken INI
   files no longer crash the filter. (great feature!)

4. Corrected logging of filter priority changes in the ini file.

5. using escaped URLs in the replacement pattern works now.

6. Requesting a very long path no longer causes IIRF to crash  with a
   "Buffer too small" error.


------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.13

1. fixed a minor bug in log message formatting where the code was using
   sizeof(message[0])/sizeof(message) instead of
   sizeof(message)/sizeof(message[0]).
   This was not a buffer overflow problem, because the code uses
   safe string routines. But it meant that log messages were not
   properly formatted.

2. Added Case Conversion in substitution string. Cool!

3. Compiled with PCRE v7.6, which fixes several security issues
   with PCRE.

4. Corrected linker options to prevent conflicting libraries
   (CMT).

------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.12a
1. added handling to allow escaping of % character in the
   replacement string.  This would allow a replacement string
   to include %26, for example, to pass an ampersand.  %%
   escapes a %, and $$ escapes a $.   This was work item 9910.

v1.2.12b

2. workitem 9858.  Fixed a memory leak which occurred when a chain of
   RewriteCond's evaluated to false.
   http://www.codeplex.com/IIRF/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=9858

v1.2.12c

3. changed LogMsg() values for various messages to allow LogLevel
   setting of 1 to be used on high-volume websites.

4. memory leak in ReplaceServerVariables.  Previously had never
   free'd myCopy.  This is now fixed. See work item 9204.
   http://www.codeplex.com/IIRF/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=9024
   and also 10528:
   http://www.codeplex.com/IIRF/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=10528

5. Default compile is now /O2, for faster execution and smaller
   memory consumption.

v1.2.12d

6. changed diagnostics in GetServerVariable_AutoFree() to handle
   case where the server var is not set yet.  This is to comply
   with URL normalization recommendations for IIS6 and 5.  First
   we try the IIS6 way, which will give us no joy on IIS5. The
   diagnostic (log) message now reflects this.


------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.11

1. fixed a bug with handling of the pattern when dealing with
   $10 or above in the replacement string. (skipping the second
   digit of the number).

2. Fixed a bug where old values of OriginalUrl and RequestMethod
   were hanging around in context.  This fix involved re-working
   logic in onUrlMap (thanks to rdlejo).

3. included support for a new directive:  RewriteFilterPriority ,
   which sets the filter priority.  Check the readme for
   details. This is helpful for sites that have PHP or other
   ISAPIs that require IIRF to be set to HIGH priority.

4. added support for including server variables in the
   replacement pattern for a RewriteRule.  eg %{QUERY_STRING} in
   the replacement pattern embeds the query string into the
   output (rewritten) URL.

v1.2.11c:

5. added lmiller's fix to support https in redirections. Now we
   redirect using the same protocol as the original request,
   rather than redirecting only to http://

   IIRF now logs the priority level as a string in addition to the
   numerical constant.

v1.2.11d:

6. Corrected the makefile to remove unnecessary dependency on
   $(PSDK)\lib\AdvAPI32.Lib .  Previously this library was used
   for RegOpenKeyEx(), but since v1.1, IIRF has used an ini
   file, not the registry, for settings.

7. The RewriteLog directive now supports logfile (stub) names
   that include spaces.  Leading and trailing spaces are
   stripped.  This was issue 8433 on Codeplex.com/IIRF.


------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.10

1. It is now possible to chain multiple RewriteCond statements
   together using logical OR or logical AND operations.

2. RewriteCond now supports the special patterns: -d, -f, -s and
   their negations (prepend with !). These test if a directory
   exists, a file exists, and if a file is of non-zero size,
   respectively.

3. IsDuplicateRule() incorrectly flagged as duplicates, two
   RewriteRules that had different RewriteCond's.  This is now
   corrected, and handles chained RewriteCond's.

4. Combining modifier flags on a RewriteRule wasn't really
   working, due to errors in parsing logic. This is now
   corrected.

5. The minimum value for IterationLimit is now 1 (changed from
   8).

6. Fixed some log statements (for loglevel >=4) which were
   overflowing because of insufficient buffer sizes.


------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.9

1. Ha ha ha !  Contrary to the release notes, I didn't actually
   implement the [U] flag in v1.2.8.  However, it is now
   implemented in 1.2.9.  The use of the [U] flag not only sets
   the HTTP_X_REWRITE_URL Server Variable, but also tells IIS to
   log the original, pre-rewrite URL in the IIS log file.  This
   is known as "unmangling" the URL.  Essentally the
   search-engine friendly URLs (pre-rewrite) get logged in the
   IIS logs.  Please check the README for details on the [U]
   flag.


------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.8

1. Implemented additional modifier flags: [NF] [F] [L] [U] [I],
   and also an expansion of the existing [R] flag (added in
   1.2.4) to include [R=code], to support 404 (Not Found), 403
   (Forbidden), and additional redirect codes beyond 302.  Also
   added some tests to exercise and demonstrate these modifier
   flags.

2. reverted to fopen() rather than fopen_s() for the ini
   file in the filter, because fopen_s() implies exclusive
   access to the ini file, and this was failing when the ini
   file was held open in a text editor.  I had moved to
   fopen_s() because fopen() is deprecated in vc8, for security
   reasons.  But shared access (fopen()) is particularly useful
   when iteratively configuring the ini file: set the ini file,
   then watch it reload, test the urls, etc. So back to fopen()
   it is.  This is only for the ini file, not for the logfile.

   Because I use the old (deprecated) library routine, there is
   a compiler warning when you build IIRF.

3. Corrected a log buffer formatting error.  When detecting a
   change in a file, the name of the file was sometimes not
   correct - due to lack of proper null-termination.

4. Inserted validation checks and better logging for
   MaxMatchCount and IterationLimit directives.

5. Inserted a check of the log file directory specified by the
   RewriteLog directive.  If the log file directory is the same
   as the ini file directory, IIRF logs a WARNING message which
   advises you to not do this.  See the readme for more details
   on why you don't want to do this.

6. Corrected a bug where there is no RewriteLog directive in
   the ini file.  The code was testing for a null log file name =="",
   rather than =='\0'.  This meant the app was trying to open a
   file with no name, for logging.  IIRF no longer does this.

------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.6

1. removed the newline from log messages - which was introduced when
   converting to the ctime_s() routine with the change to ms vc8.

2. swapped from fopen_s() to _fsopen() for the log files.  This
   allows others to read the logfile while it is being written.
   fopen() also does this, but the behavior of fopen_s() is different.

3. AwaitIniChangeAndReinit(): raised the log level to 4, for
   logging messages when detecting a change in a file. Changes
   can occur frequently and generally we don't want to hear
   about them in the logfile, unless we are troubleshooting the
   file watcher mechanism itself.  For changes in the actual ini
   file, that log level is still "1", because it is generally an
   event of interest.


------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.5

1. Compiled on MS VC8, the C++ compiler that ships with Visual
   Studio 2005. Changed makefiles to do this. Also compiled
   with Visual-C++ 2005 Express, the free version of Visual C++.

2. Replaced all instances of deprecated CRT routines with the
   _s (secure) versions.  These include _itoa_s, strncpy_s,
   sprintf_s, fopen_s, strtok_s, and numerous others.

3. Packaged up PCRE-5.0 differently in the zip archive, to make
   building easier.


------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.4

1. Implemented the [R] modifier for redirection (HTTP 302).
   Added a test directory to demonstrate redirection.

2. Fixed a really bad design in the TestDriver that prevented
   it from ever exiting.  What was I thinking here?

3. Modified the output messages generated by TestDriver.exe.
   There is now additional text that indicates REWRITE or
   REDIRECT as appropriate.

4. Also modified the LogMsg() routine so that log messages are not
   duplicated duplicated when run from the TestDriver.exe.

------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.3

1. Corrected a race condition on exit, having to do with the
   inifile Watcher thread.  This involved a change to the
   CreateFile() call which opens the directory for
   ReadDirectoryChangesW.  The CreateFile() now  passes
   FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED to allow async operations.  When the
   ISAPI is terminating (DLL_PROCESS_DETACH), the main thread
   closes the dir handle, which causes    ReadDirectoryChangesW
   to wake up in the inifile Watcher thread.  The thread then
   exits properly.

2. Corrected a couple of string pointer manipulation problems in
   ReplaceServerVariables().  These bugs were causing garbage to
   sometimes appear in the output of RewriteCond test
   strings. This sometimes caused RewriteCond to evaluate
   incorrectly.



------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.2

1. Added more flexibility to the TestDriver, so that you can
   organize tests into multiple independent directories.

2. Added some tests to demonstrate techniques.  See the tests subdirectory.

3. changed the makefile to compile with /Zi, which includes
   debug information in the executable image.


------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.1

1. The RewriteCond was obliterating matches for the associated
   RewriteRule.  This is fixed now.

2. Updated the readme with additional examples. Fixed a few
   errors in the readme as well (stale info about reading
   logging settings from Registry, etc).



------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2

1. The filter watches for changes in the ini file, and
   re-initializes when the ini file changes.



------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.1


1. The Readme doc stated that the directives in the ini file
   were case-sensitive.  They are not.  So

     ReWriteRule

   is the same as
     RewriteRule

   is the same as
     REWRITERULE


2. A new directive, RewriteCond, is now supported.  See the
   Readme doc for how to use it.


3. Logging settings moved from the registry to the ini file.
   RewriteLog and RewriteLogLevel are the directives.  (not case
   sensitive)


4. The Logfilename specified in the ini file is used as the
   rootname, this filter appends the pid and ".log" to the
   provided name to get the final filename.  This is necessary
   for multiple worker processes in IIS6.  Example:

   RewriteLog c:\temp\iirf

   gives a net logfilename of

       c:\temp\iirf.1672.log

   if the process ID of the w3wp.exe is 1672.
   You will get multiple logfiles if you have multiple worker
   processes.


5. The logging system no longer opens and closes the file for
   each action.  instead the log is fflushed for every log
   statement.  This is still a not insignificant performance hit.
