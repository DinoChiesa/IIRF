# This is an example of a "cycle" in the rewrite logic.  In
# general, a cycle happens when the output of one rule will
# satisfy the pattern of another rule.  It is not always
# apparent when this will occur.  This particular example is not
# an endless cycle; instead as you can see, it stops at a
# maximum of about 7 loops.
