# IsapiRewrite4.ini
#
# This ini file shows how to transform a URL into a query string, piecewise, iteratively.
# In this case, path segments come in pairs.  The first of the pair is the param
# name, the second of the pair is the param value.  So, a pair of path segments in
# the request URL like .../a/b... will result in a rewrite of ?a=b.

# Handle the case with one more pair of segments. This fires once (last).
# It fires when there is an even number of segments.

# Handle the edge case, where there is an odd number of segments (invalid input URL)
# This fires once, after all the other pairs have been parsed.  In fact the filter
# cannot know that there is an odd number of segments until it does all the matching.
# So at the end we see, we have one left over segment, and we 
# redirect to a 404 page.
