RewriteLogLevel 5

# -------------------------------------------------------
# This rule shows how to transform a URL into a query string, in one go.
# This rule specifically disallows any incoming URL that begins with "controller.jsp" or with "inc"

RewriteRule ^/(?!controller.jsp)(?!web)(?!inc)(?!a)(.+)$ /controller.jsp?v=$1 [L]



# -------------------------------------------------------
# This rule shows how to transform a URL into a query string, 
# breaking it into pieces.  The first segment is placed into the first
# query param, and the remainder in a different param.

# This rule applies only when the first segment in the URL
# begins with the letter a.  [via (a[^\?\/]*)]

# As above, this rule specifically disallows any incoming URL
# that begins with "controller.jsp" [ via (?!controller.jsp)] or
# with "inc" [ via (?!inc)].


RewriteRule ^/(?!controller.jsp)(?!web)(?!inc)(a[^\?\/]*)/([^\?]+)$ /controller.jsp?page=$1&v=$2 [L]





# -------------------------------------------------------
# This set of rules shows how to transform a URL into a query string.
# There are three possibilities: the requested URL can have one, two or three segments.
# There is a distinct rule for each case.

# one segment
RewriteRule  /web/([^\/]+)/$  /content-web.aspx?country=$1   [L]

# two segments
RewriteRule  /web/([^\/]+)/([^\/]+)/$  /content-web.aspx?country=$1&city=$2   [L]

# three segments
RewriteRule  /web/([^\/]+)/([^\/]+)/([^\/]+)/$  /content-web.aspx?country=$1&city=$2&area=$3   [L]
 

#add a trailing slash when there is no query string (use a negative lookbehind)
RewriteRule  /web/(.+)(?<!\/)$  /web/$1/
