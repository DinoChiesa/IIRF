RewriteLogLevel 5

# -------------------------------------------------------

# This rule shows how to transform a URL into a query string, piecewise, iteratively.
# In this case, each path segment in the original URL (entered in the browser)
# becomes the value of a query param, which is named "v".  That is to say, the result
# is a URL with a multiply-valued query param named v, it has many values.  The
# receiving app (in this case index.cfm) needs to iterate through all the v values.
# Presumably they will have positional significance.  In other words
# index.cfm?v=9&v=123 will mean something different from index.cfm?v=123&v=9.  But
# that is up to the application, isn't it?

# The way it works - we rewrite once for the first case, in order to get the question
# mark.  Subsequent passes through the filter will add query params as necessary.
# Then there is the final case.  Run this test and examine the output, and the
# meaning will be clearer.



# handle case with no query string .  This rule fires the first time through.
RewriteRule ^/(?!index\.cfm)([^\?\/]+)/([^\?]+)$ /$2?v=$1

# handle case with existing query string. This rule fires potentially multiple times.
RewriteRule ^/(?!index\.cfm)([^\?\/]+)/([^\?]+)\?(.+)$ /$2?$3&v=$1

# handle case with one more segment. This fires once (last).
RewriteRule ^/(?!index\.cfm)([^\/]+)\?([^\?]+)$ /index.cfm?$2&v=$1  [L]

# handle edge case, where there is only one segment. This fires once (last).
RewriteRule ^/(?!index\.cfm)([^\/]+)$ /index.cfm?v=$1  [L]
