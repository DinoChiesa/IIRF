RewriteLogLevel 3


# This rule uses three "negative look-ahead" patterns.  The
# negative look-ahead starts with ?!, and then includes a
# pattern.  It evaluates to true, when the pattern is NOT
# matched.  Because it evaluates to true on no match, it does
# not fill a $n variable that you can use in the replacement
# string.

# This one says:
# For any line that does NOT: 
#    A. begin with /index.php
#    B. end in a slash  (eg, http://foo/bar/ )
#    C. end in .html 
# then, match the entire URL, except for the leading slash, 
# and rewrite it to /index.php?<original Url here>
#
# This is best illustrated by the SampleUrls !  
# Run the testdriver.exe and see for yourself.
