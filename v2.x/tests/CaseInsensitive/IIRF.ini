# This ini file illustrates the use of case-insensitive pattern
# matching in IIRF. 
#



# This rule matches only simple top-level URLs that end in .jsp.  
# A matching URL is rewritten to be an .aspx page.

RewriteRule ^/([^\.\/]+)\.jsp$  /$1.aspx




# This rule matches only simple top-level URLs that end in .jsp,
# but, where the .jsp is not all lower case.  Actually it matches *any*
# URL that ends in JSP, of any case, but all the URLs that end in lowercase 
# .jsp are rewritten by the prior URL.  So the only URLs that do not end in 
# .jsp (all lowercase) could possibly reach this rule.
#
# Because this rule uses the [I] modifier, it matches URLs that end in
# .jsp when .jsp is in any case. With a match, the URL is REDIRECTED to
# a page called PleaseUseAllLowerCase.aspx, and the original URL is
# passed as a query param.
#
# Keep in mind that [NC] is a synonum for [I].
# 
#---------------------------------------------
#                $1

RedirectRule ^/([^\.\/]+\.jsp)$   /PleaseUseAllLowerCase.aspx?originalRequest=$1   [I]



# This rule matches anything that ends in .cfm (case
# insensitive), and rewrites the URL.  The local case-insensitive
# behavior is provided by the ?i syntax of PCRE.  No [I] flag is
# necessary in this case.  
#
RewriteRule ^/([^\.\/]+)\.(?i)cfm$   /main.cfm?$1


# This rule matches a URL that starts with Hello.php, where only
# the .php is matched as case-insensitive.  This uses the
# internal 'i' option in PCRE.
#

RewriteRule ^/Hello\.((?i)php)$  /Bonjour.php




# This rule matches a URL that starts with foros, in either upper or lower case. 
# [NC] is a synonum for [I].

RewriteRule ^/foros/?$  /foros.php  [NC,L]
